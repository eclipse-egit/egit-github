      "message": "It took a bit of time for me to figure out how to submit the reply. But, I\u0027ve reached out to the GitHub support, they mentioned that the API has a few preview fields (and not the endpoint itself), and the change I have made does not use any of those. I\u0027ve added the reply from GitHub support @ https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d529850 -- \"Ah, I just noticed why that endpoint is listed as in preview. You can call that endpoint with or without a preview header, but if you supply the preview header that\u0027s mentioned in the documentation -- each team in the list will contain more information (for example, they will have the \"parent\" field which tells you what the parent team is for that team).\"",
