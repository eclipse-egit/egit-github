      "message": "I use to copy the latest release to this update site manually, looks like I missed this for 5.4. 5.4 should be available at https://download.eclipse.org/egit/github/updates-5.4\n\nSince this week ssh access to build.eclipse.org only provides a very limited shell. E.g. there is no more cd, no tab completion etc.\nHence copying manually became messy.\n\nActually I tried to delete the current content of https://download.eclipse.org/egit/github/updates but this just doesn\u0027t work anymore using this restricted shell, though I think it should.\n\nLooks like we need to add Jenkins jobs for such releng work.",

I had somehow assumed that .../updates was simply a link that would be set automatically on the release day to point to the latest updates-X.Y folder. But yes, we can add a \"release\" job on Jenkins that copies both egit and egit-github to these locations.",
